        <h3>The Snowstorm Saga</h3>
        <div class="blog-date">Posted: 2/2/26 — ISM Blog MP 3</div>
        <p>This past week in ISM has been very unique due to the snowstorm that affected many things. Our ISM Showcase was temporarily cancelled, and so the display boards and presentations that we had spent so much time working on will have to wait to be seen by the public. However, I am very excited that we have begun the process of creating our final product that is a culmination of the work we have done in ISM. All the research we have done and skills we have gained have been building up to this, and while by no means are these things done, it's really awesome that we can start working on our main project. We are currently in the proposal stage of the process, and I have proposed that I will build an app that builds off my original work website to provide a more accessible resource for taxpayers that can inform them about key tax concepts and also guide them towards valuable resources. I will use the new knowledge I gain from additional research and interviews I conduct to add to the content on my website, so that my app is even more comprehensive and helpful. I will also add multiple new features, like one that determines your filing status to help taxpayers apply concepts to their unique situations, making the app personalized. One thing I feel that I have done well is creating an organized calendar, as I have a tentative schedule planned out for the next two months in ISM. One thing I want to continue working on is making any design elements in my creations visually appealing, as I am not super artistic, and this can really differentiate a successful and failed product.</p>

        <h3>Preparing for the Showcase</h3>
        <div class="blog-date">Posted: 1/26/26</div>
        <p>Over the past two weeks in ISM, I have made considerable progress across multiple areas of the program, all stemming from the work I am doing with my display board. I have created a professional and informative display board showcasing my work in ISM so far, highlighting my Original Work. It took a lot of time and effort to make it look very professional and appealing, and I am very proud of it. Last thursday, we did a sort of mock showcase in the library and we were able to do our short presentations of our display boards to various classes that were walking around. I was able to improve my presentation skills which each new person that listened to me, as the primary thing that I improved upon was getting to the point. I realized I should be talking less about myself and my background and instead get straight to my original work website, because that was the important and meaningful part of my presentation. One area that I am looking to improve upon prior to my final showcase night is incorporating the actual navigation of my website(clicking links at proper times) into my presentation as this will keep listeners engaged and hooked.</p>

        <h3>The Mentorship Journey Begins</h3>
        <div class="blog-date">Posted: 1/12/26</div>
        <p>Over the last month in ISM, I have taken so many huge strides in this class, manifesting through both the completion of my original work and the beginning of my mentorship journey with Ms. Robbins. I am really excited to spend the rest of the year in ISM working under the guidance of Ms. Robbins, as she has offered me so many valuable insights so far and I know she will be an amazing resource throughout the creation process of my final product. She has already suggested to me improvements that I can make with my original work that I will implement, and it has allowed my product to be more comprehensive and meaningful. On the topic of my original work, I have completed my tax education website to be fully functional, and the last, final part that I have already begun(and almost finished) is getting the website hosted on a platform like GitHub. One area of improvement that I am looking to work on as the year progresses is being more collected when giving speeches/presentations, as I noticed in my last speech in class that I would rock back and forth. I am really looking forward to completing my display board this week and beginning preparations for our ISM Showcase Night where I can present my work so far in ISM to a large audience, which will be a completely new experience for me.</p>

        <h3>Website Wrap-Up</h3>
        <div class="blog-date">Posted: 12/08/25 — ISM Blog MP 2</div>
        <p>Most of my work in ISM over the past couple of weeks has been primarily focused on completing my Original Work. The deadline for this is this Friday and quickly approaching, and I am really close to having a finished product. My idea has developed and transformed as I have conducted more research and more interviews, and it has finally taken form now. My website provides tax assistance to under-knowledged people through informational web pages and direction toward available resources. I also added a section about fraudulent tax preparations because of the insights I was offered through my informational interviews with professionals. Furthermore, we are currently working on our Research Speech, and I have been able to reflect upon my growth and knowledge gained over the course of this semester in ISM. This speech is longer and more difficult than any presentation I have given before, and it is really testing my skills. One area of success for me in this process has been being able to speak with a good tone and confidence, as I have improved my vocalization. One area of improvement that I am looking to improve upon is minimizing filler words like "uh" and "um", as this can affect the clarity of my speaking. I have made a lot of progress this semester in ISM and I am looking forward to finishing strong with a successful speech and Original Work product, and I am really looking forward to doing more meaningful work next semester!</p>

        <h3>Onwards with my Original Work</h3>
        <div class="blog-date">Posted: 11/18/25</div>
        <p>In ISM, the past two weeks have been really eventful as I have conducted numerous interviews, gained a lot of new valuable knowledge, and narrowed down what I want my specific project to look like. While researching my general topic I came across a program called the Low Income Taxpayer Clinic, which handles legal issues that low income people face when filing their tax returns. I thought people who work here would have a good understanding of issues low income taxpayers face, so I emailed professors from various colleges who ran the LITC at their college. I was able to conduct two interviews, with Mr. Firouzi from Temple University and Mr. Nassau from Syracuse University. To summarize their insights, they gave me positive feedback on my original work idea of creating a tax education product, but also told me to look into specific marketing strategies and also explore fraudulent tax preparer awareness. One marketing idea that I found to be very helpful was reaching out to nonprofit organizations that worked with low income people, as this would allow me to get my product to a target audience. I faced challenges over the past two weeks with narrowing down my project idea, but after my interviews I have a more clear idea of what my original work will look like and I have begun making it a reality. One area of improvement that I want to work on is building off responses from interviewees effectively, as sometimes I can stumble on my words when trying to respond to professionals on the spot. I am looking forward to conducting more interviews and actually creating my working product in the near future.</p>

        <h3>Initiating Interviews</h3>
        <div class="blog-date">Posted: 11/3/25</div>
        <p>Over the past two weeks in ISM, I have conducted multiple interviews and improved both my technical knowledge and my interpersonal skills. My first interview went very well as I conversed with Mr. Reddy, an executive at Ernst and Young, a financial auditing firm. We talked about topics relating to his jobs and the finances of a firm such as theirs, but Mr. Reddy was also very knowledgeable about personal finance, so we discussed that too. My second interview occurred last Friday with Ms. Robbins, a site coordinator for VITA(Volunteer Income Tax Assistance) Dallas. I had experience working with her when I volunteered with VITA, and she was able to offer me numerous insights regarding issues that existed on both the administrative side and the client side with the VITA program. Through the knowledge I gained from these two interviews, I was able to create a more concise idea regarding what I want to do for my original work. I see that awareness and accessibility are two issues I want to address through the resources I make to assist low-income individuals and families with their tax returns. One thing that I did well with my interviews was striking a balance between general questions like asking about their career and then specific questions regarding my ISM topic, and it didn't feel rushed or forced. One area of improvement for my next interview is asking questions that allow me to further narrow my topic so that I can get a concrete idea for my original work.</p>

        <h3>Networking Tales</h3>
        <div class="blog-date">Posted: 10/21/25</div>
        <p>This past week in ISM, I attended the Business/Technology/Finance Meet-Up at UNT Frisco. This event was my first true networking opportunity and I was able to accomplish and learn a lot. The three mentors were very insightful, and I particularly enjoyed being able to ask questions about the finance industry to Mr. Putnam, as he had a wealth of knowledge. Mr. Krishna also offered some very insightful advice about the importance of reflection and being a lifelong learner. Furthermore, I was able to talk to a lot of other ISM students who had similar topics to me, as we chose the Meet-Up session that aligned with our interests, and I was able to hear about various unique experiences and original work ideas. I gained many new contacts, and I was able to start a conversation with one person I met after the Meet-Up, and we might be collaborating on a project that isn't affiliated with ISM. I am really happy that I was able to properly network with people and stay in contact with them after the event, and I am looking forward to other opportunities like this in the future. In ISM we are also starting to think about what we will be doing for our original work, and I got numerous ideas down on paper during our brainstorming session. The feedback and suggestions that I received from my peers were very valuable and will help me narrow down my ideas. One area of success for me was putting myself out there during the meet up and truly building a network by collecting contacts. One area of improvement over the next week of ISM is being more specific with my ideas, as currently my brainstorming is very broad.</p>

        <h3>The Symposium Experience</h3>
        <div class="blog-date">Posted: 9/29/25 — ISM Blog MP 1</div>
        <p>Last week was the ISM Symposium and I was able to have an experience that was unlike anything I had done before. I learnt so much about so many different topics from ISM 2 students, ISM alumni, professionals in various fields, and even my fellow peers. The most memorable part and my personal favorite portion of the symposium were the interview sessions with the professionals. I had conversations with two mentors from the field of business/finance, which I was very lucky to experience as not everyone had discussions with professionals from their field. One of my interviews was with a professional who owned his own consulting firm, and I had a more structured interview with him where he asked me questions that I was prepared for, but towards the end he also asked me questions about my specific experiences with investing and he shared some of his insights too. My other interview was completely unstructured as my interviewer did not ask me a single question from the sheet I had prepared for. This professional was the former CFO of Sewell Automotive Companies, and I personally enjoyed this interview the most. He asked questions that I wasn't prepared for so I had to think on my feet, but we had a great discussion about some of the activities I did and my future aspirations. The other sessions during the symposium were also very informative and they opened my eyes to new ways of thinking. Looking back on the event, one area that I would like to improve in is asking questions. I felt like I could have asked more/better questions during the meet-and-greet that made me stand out to the professionals, as I don't want to be asking the same questions as everyone else there. I do believe that one area I succeeded in was my responses to the interview questions, as I was confident, honest, and direct. Overall the symposium was a great experience, and it definitely made me a more mature student and communicator.</p>

        <h3>Diving into Tax Reform</h3>
        <div class="blog-date">Posted: 9/22/25</div>
        <p>This past week, I was able to take the topic of taxes and really explore it deeply. For the research assessment, I spent a lot of time looking for issues in the world of taxes, and I was able to find various different niche areas. One topic that I was already familiar with was helping low-income families with tax disadvantages they faced. During my annotated bibliography, I explored the public's awareness of the VITA program in the United States. I was introduced to the issue of low-income families/individuals not having proper knowledge of the resources available to them. Then, during the research assessment, I explored a tax-refund program in Brazil, and a similar issue the authors brought up was that the public didn't know they could claim these benefits. Currently, one transcending idea that I am seeing pop up repeatedly is the lack of awareness among those struggling financially about the resources that exist to help them. This seems like something that could eventually spark into a concrete project in the future. One area that I have seen myself improve in is the usage of APA, as I am getting more comfortable with it. One area that I believe I can work on that is separate from the assignments we have done is improving my clarity in public speaking. During the mock interviews we conducted in class, I would stutter/use filler words in my responses, so I want to improve this and project myself more confidently.</p>

        <h3>Tax Adventure</h3>
        <div class="blog-date">Posted: 9/15/25</div>
        <p>Over this past week, I have made a lot of progress in narrowing down my topic of study that I am interested in exploring. At this point around a week ago, I didn't know what pathway in finance I wanted to explore through ISM, as finance was just a general topic I had in mind. While I still do not have a fully concrete understanding of my specific topic of study, I have found one branch of finance that I find more interesting than others: taxes. I was able to gain a lot of clarity through conducting research for my annotated bibliography, as I explored numerous aspects of finance like corporate finance, asset management, investment banking, and of course, taxes. Through my research for my annotated bibliography, I was able to explore topics that were even more specific than just taxes, like income taxes, corporate taxes, tax fraud, and more. After looking at research articles about all these topics, I found that income tax returns piqued my interest the most. I am not completely sure that this is the exact topic that I will work on throughout ISM, but I am excited that I have finally begun the process of narrowing down my topic and finding a niche area of interest. One challenge I faced over the last week was figuring out how to format my citations for APA properly, as I am still very unfamiliar with this style. However, I was able to overcome this by using resources such as Purdue OWL and Scribr, which guided me through creating accurate citations. Since APA is the primary citation style used in the field of finance, this knowledge will be beneficial to me for the foreseeable future. I am eager to learn more about various aspects of taxes and further narrow my topic down to a specific and meaningful issue.</p>

        <h3>The Journey Begins</h3>
        <div class="blog-date">Posted: 9/9/25</div>
        <p>Even though I have only been in ISM for a couple of weeks, I have already delved much deeper into my passion for finance than I have so far. Most recently, while conducting research on careers in finance, I found so many new branches and pathways that I had not even considered before. The two main aspects of finance that I was familiar with were investment banking and corporate finance, but my research opened my eyes to pathways like real estate and portfolio management, to name a few. One specific pathway that I really want to learn more about is taxes and the tax system. One challenge I faced while conducting my research was finding articles that matched what I was looking for. At the beginning of my research I kept getting articles about finance that had nothing to do with what I was looking for. However, I was able to overcome this challenge by using more specific key words and using the advanced search feature to narrow down my results. This was very beneficial as the sources that the databases were providing were actually relevant to my research objective. I was successful in making sure all my work for the week was completed in a timely manner, but one thing I can work on is working more in advance to the due date so that I have less work for the days leading up to the deadline for submission. Overall, I feel like I am off to a great start in ISM and I look forward to the opportunities that this program will open up for me.</p>
