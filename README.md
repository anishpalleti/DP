## Quick start

1. **Domain:** Use a professional domain with your name (e.g. `john.smith.wordpress.com` or your own domain).
2. **Color scheme:** The site uses a dark finance/tech theme (slate + teal accent). To change colors, edit the `:root` variables in `styles.css`.
3. **Images:** Add `images/cover.jpg`, `images/profile.jpg`, `images/mentor.jpg`, `images/ism-logo.png` as needed. Use images labeled for reuse or provide a work-cited page.
4. **Résumé:** Put your PDF in `documents/resume.pdf` so the Download button works.
5. Open `index.html` in a browser, or host the folder on any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Canva, etc.).

## Notes

- Comments: If you move to a platform with comments, set them to “approval” before publishing.

- Keep blog and descriptions professional and positive.
